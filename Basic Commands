##Basic Commands 
ifconfig
Ifconfig-The ifconfig command is used to configure, manage, and display network interface settings
on Unix-like operating systems. It allows you to view or modify IP addresses, netmasks, and other
network parameters .
Basic Networking Commands
2) ip
The ip command is used to manage and display network interfaces, IP addresses, routes, and traffic
control in modern Unix-like operating systems. It replaces the older ifconfig command and provides
more features, including support for IPv6 and advanced routing.
Basic Networking Commands
3) traceroute
The traceroute command is used to display the route that packets take to reach a destination on a
network. It shows the hops (intermediate devices like routers) along the path and the response
times for each hop.
4) tracepath
The tracepath command is used to trace the route to a destination, similar to traceroute, but with
fewer privileges. It is primarily used for diagnosing network issues and automatically determines the
Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) along the path, which can help identify MTU-related problems.
Basic Networking Commands
5) ping
The ping command is used to test the connectivity between your machine and a remote host. It
sends request packets and measures the time it takes to receive a response, helping diagnose
network issues like packet loss or latency.
6) netstat
The netstat command is used to display network connections, routing tables, interface statistics, and
open ports on a system. It helps monitor network activity and troubleshoot network-related issues.
Basic Networking Commands
7) ss
The ss command is used to display detailed information about network connections, sockets, and
listening ports. It is faster and more efficient than netstat, offering advanced filtering and better
support for modern protocols like TCP, UDP, and Unix domain sockets.
8) dig
dig (Domain Information Groper) is a tool used to query DNS (Domain Name System) servers for
information about domain names, IP addresses, and DNS records.
Basic Networking Commands
9) nslookup
nslookup is a command-line tool used to query DNS to obtain domain name or IP address
information. It's commonly used to troubleshoot DNS-related issues.
Basic Networking Commands
10) route
route is used to view or modify the system's IP routing table, which determines the paths that
network traffic will follow to reach a destination.
11) host
host is a simple command used to perform DNS lookups and convert domain names to IP addresses
(and vice versa), similar to dig and nslookup.
Basic Networking Commands
12) arp
arp (Address Resolution Protocol) is used to display and manipulate the ARP cache, which maps IP
addresses to physical MAC addresses on a local network.
13) hostname
hostname is used to display or set the systemâ€™s hostname, which is the name used to identify the
machine on a network.
Basic Networking Commands
14) wget
wget is a command-line tool for downloading files from the web using HTTP, HTTPS, or FTP
protocols. It supports features like recursive downloads and automatic retries.
15) mtr
mtr (My Traceroute) is a network diagnostic tool combining traceroute and ping functionality. It
provides real-time information about the route and quality of each hop between your machine and a
destination.
Basic Networking Commands
16) whois
whois is used to query databases to retrieve information about domain names, IP addresses, and
network resources, including domain registration details.
Basic Networking Commands
17) tcpdump
tcpdump is a packet analyzer used for capturing and inspecting network traffic. It allows detailed
monitoring of packets sent over the network, useful for troubleshooting and security analysis.
